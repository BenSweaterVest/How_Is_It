# How Spicy Is It?

An interactive web tool for communicating intensity levels using scientific scales as humorous metaphors.

## Concept

Use real, measurable scientific scales (like the Scoville scale for peppers) to describe abstract situations. Say "this meeting is going to be Carolina Reaper level" or "this email is habanero spicy" and share a visual reference.

## Features

- **Interactive Scale**: Horizontal visualization of the complete Scoville scale (0 to 3+ million SHU)
- **33 Peppers**: Comprehensive data from Bell Peppers to Pepper X
- **Dynamic Hover Effects**: Items grow and show detailed tooltips on hover
- **Search Functionality**: Find peppers by name or description
- **Shareable Links**: Click any pepper to generate a URL you can share
- **Beautiful Gradients**: Visual design inspired by neal.fun and Information is Beautiful
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. **Browse**: Hover over peppers on the scale to see details
2. **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific peppers
3. **Select**: Click a pepper to select it
4. **Share**: Copy the generated link to share with others

## Design Inspiration

- [ptable.com](https://ptable.com) - Clean layout, everything visible at once
- [neal.fun](https://neal.fun) - Playful illustrated style
- [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net) - Data visualization aesthetics

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no dependencies)
- Smooth CSS transitions and animations
- URL parameter-based sharing
- Responsive grid layout
- Emoji-based visual design

## Future Modes

The architecture supports adding additional scales:
- Richter Scale (earthquakes)
- pH Scale (acidity/alkalinity)
- Decibel Scale (sound)
- Beaufort Scale (wind)
- Mohs Hardness Scale (minerals)
- UV Index
- Caffeine Content

## Running Locally

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process or server required.

## Data Accuracy

All Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) measurements are based on commonly accepted ranges for each pepper variety. Some peppers have wide ranges due to growing conditions, ripeness, and genetic variation.
